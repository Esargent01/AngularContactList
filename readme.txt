This is a contact form written in AngularJS. The application does not include testing. Since a pixel grid was not specified, I went with a 15px grid. Spacing between elements should all be divisible by 15 and distinctly show the relationship between elements.

Walkthrough:

Installation: 
	There is no installation required. All of the files and depedencies are included in the folder of the application.

Opertation:
	As simple as opening the index file and adding your contacts.
